# Snake-Game
This project is a classic Snake Game built using React, JavaScript, and Singly Linked Lists to manage the snake's body. The goal of the game is for the player to control the snake, guiding it to eat food(red) and grow longer without colliding with the walls or its own body. It also incorporates a feature to reverse the snake's body using Linked List reversal on eating a purple food item.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and handling component-based architecture.
JavaScript: For the game's logic and functionality.
Singly Linked Lists: To manage the snake's body and its growing length.
